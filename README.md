# COVID19-Spain
Interactive analysis of COVID-19 data in Spain

**Important:** Data is not updated anymore. For high quality and up date analyses I recommend the following two twitter accounts: @ngdpadel2 and @mianrey.

## Credits and source of data
Credits go to the contributors of the repository https://github.com/datadista/datasets for making the data available. The underlying data is updated every morning CET when the Spanish health ministry updates the numbers. 

## Usage

Click https://l47y.shinyapps.io/covid19-spain/ to open the app. There are limited resources, so the app could be slow. 

To run the app locally, execute:

```r 
shiny::runGitHub("COVID19-Spain", "l47y")
```
